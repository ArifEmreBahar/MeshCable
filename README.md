# MeshCable
A Unity framework for procedural cables, linking endpoints with tubular meshes shaped by BÃ©zier curves. MeshCable handles mesh setup, while a global Calculator runs Burst jobs to update vertices each frame, syncing physics and Photon multiplayer for consistent, scalable cable simulation.
